        subtitle: Assistant Professor
        content: >
          I have a bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication
          Engineering, a masters in Geomatics Engineering, and a PhD in Geodesy.
          In my   masters thesis I worked on analyzing GRACE timeseries and in
          my PhD I developed data-driven methods to process level 2 GRACE data
          at catchment scale. I work with multiple Earth observation datasets to
          estimate various surface processes that are related to ongoing climate
          change. In my free time I like to play badminton and cricket.


          My research interest:


          *   satellite gravimetry


          *   signal processing


          *   climate change


          *   data-driven methods
