          I have a bachelors degree in Electronics and Communication
          Engineering, wherein my favorite subject was signal processing.
          Intrigued by the application of signal processing in real world, I did
          a masters in Geomatics Engineering, where analysis of geospatial data
          is a routine job. In my   masters thesis I worked on analysing GRACE
          timeseries and in my PhD I developed data-driven methods to process
          level 2 GRACE data at catchment scale. Please get in touch if you want
          to learn more about the GRACE satellite mission of about the latest
          research from the GESS group at ICWaR, IISc.


          In recent years, I have worked with multiple Earth observation
          datasets to find that several surface processes are an excellent
          indicator of ongoing changes in the Earth system due to climate
          change. For example, the temperature is rising, glaciers and
          ice-sheets are melting, sea level is rising, due to mass
          redistribution both the geoid and solid Earth are changing, which
          means the relative sea level is changing differently at diffeent
          locations. Hence to understand the implications of sea level change
          for a coastal community, you have to study all the sub-systems of the
          Earth together. In other words, systems approach should be taken into
          consideration. This is my research vision.
