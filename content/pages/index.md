    title: About
    content: >
      We are the Geodesy for Earth system science (GESS) research Group at
      ICWaR, IISC. Our group is interested in using Earth observation data for
      monitoring and understanding the changes in the Earth system. Our core
      expertise is in processing and using geodetic datasets, such as GRACE,
      GNSS and altimetry, in tandem with other Earth observation datasets/models
      for mapping various surface processes that are related to climate change
      and human activities.

      - title: Our Approach
        content: >
          Clever signal processing has been historically proven to provide novel
          insights. Looking at the same data, but after transforming it or
          processing it can help us extract patterns that tend to explain
          observed complex physical mechanisms and their spatiotemporal
          behaviour. We aspire to develop novel data-driven approaches for
          understanding natural phenomenon.

      - title: Why our approach?
        content: >
          Our planet consists of various sub-systems, such as hydrosphere,
          Lithosphere, Atmosphere and Biosphere. Traditionally we have been
          studying these sub-systems in isolation. However, recent advances in
          our understanding of our planet has taught us that studying these
          sub-systems together by including their interconnections can help us
          better understand the response of the Earth system to various
          forcings. This concept is even more important in the context of
          climate change which will affect every sub-system of the Earth. Our
          group focuses on using geodetic datasets along with other observations
          and models for elucidating the impact of climate change and human
          intervention on our hydrosphere, while taking a systems approach.
