      Welcome to the webpage of the GESS research Group at ICWaR, IISC. Our
      group is interested in using Earth observation data for monitoring and
      understanding the changes in the Earth system. Our core expertise is in
      processing and using geodetic datasets, such as GRACE, GNSS and altimetry,
      in tandem with other Earth observation datasets/models for mapping various
      surface processes that related to climate change and human activities.

      - title: Our Approach
        subtitle: >-
          It doesn't matter how beautiful your theory is, it doesn't matter how
          smart you are. If it doesn't agree with experiment, it's wrong.
          -Richard P. Feynman

          Clever signal processing has been historically proven to provide novel
          insights. Looking at the same data, but from a different perspective
          can help us pull out patterns that tend to explain observed complex
          physical mechanisms and their spatiotemporal behaviour. We aspire to
          develop novel data-driven approaches for understanding natural
          phenomenon. We have recently developed a method to estimate signals
          from glacial isostatic adjustment (response of the solid Earth to
          galcial cycles) and Present day mass change using GRACE satellite data
          and GNSS time-series (visit our Publications section for references
          that go in more details).

      - title: Why our approach?
        content: >
          Our planet consists of various sub-systems, such as hydrosphere,
          Lithosphere, Atmosphere and Biosphere. Traditionally we have been
          studying these sub-systems in isolation. However, recent advances in
          our understanding of our planet has taught us that these systems are
          interconnected and by studying them together, we can better understand
          the response of the Earth system to various forcings. This concept is
          even more important in the context of climate change. Therefore, our
          group focuses on using geodetic datasets for elucidating the impact of
          climate change and human intervention to our hydrosphere, while taking
          a systems approach.
