  GRACE data products are available at different resolutions, 3 degree, 2
  degree, 1 degree and even 0.5 degree. So users often ask what is the spatial
  resolution of the mission?

GRACE is a unique mission with unique design. It is not similar to optical remote sensing mission where we know the resolution of onboard sensor (or camera), rather it relies on geophysical inversion of the geopotential from the satellite range rate data (rate of change in the along-track distance between the two satellites in the same orbit).  Its spatial resolution cannot be expressed in terms of pixel size, or bands. In an article, the concept of the spatial resolution for a GRACE like mission was explained in detail (follow https://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/10/6/852). In short, GRACE resolution and accuracy have a tradeoff and we can  expect GRACE to capture mass changes in catchments larger than 63000 sq. km with an RMSE (Root mean square error) of 2 cm EWH (equivalent water height).
